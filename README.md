# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my (attempts at!) solutions to various competitive programming problems,
on the platform [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), and introduced to me by
[Pedro Parades](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~pparedes/) during his weekly
[Competitive Programming sessions](https://competitive-programming.cs.princeton.edu/fall22) in the
context of the [Princeton ACM](http://princeton.acm.org/).

One of my goals is to learn the programming language Go! I admit fully that I am helped by GitHub Copilot ðŸ¤–.
